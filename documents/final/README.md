# Modelling Project Final Submission

This folder contains the extra documents for the deliverables (D3) - (D5).

The relevant files, `proofs.jp` and `modelling_report.pptx` have been included. For `proofs.jp`, only three of the proofs completed are relevant to the project (the rest were for testing purposes). These three are listed and explained within `modelling_report.pptx` for more detail. Additionally, the `modelling_report.pptx` has voice recordings for every slide (they can be played in the bottom right corner for each slide). These recordings go over the relevant information, and may help in better understanding our project and rationale. 

## Due Date

December 9th, 2020

* `modelling_report.docx` or `modelling_report.pptx` or (`report.txt` and `report.pdf`): Include either the Word/PowerPoint document for your documentation, or a link to the OverLeaf project inside of `report.txt` if that is what you chose to use for (D5).
